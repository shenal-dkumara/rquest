Description: The rquest package provides a simple way to conduct hypothesis tests and derive confidence intervals for quantiles, linear combinations of quantiles, ratios of dependent linear combinations (e.g., Bowleyâ€™s measure of skewness) and differences and ratios of all of the above for comparisons between independent samples. Additionally, quantile-based measures of inequality are also considered.
